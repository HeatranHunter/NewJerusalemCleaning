            Hi, my name is David Navarro, founder of New Jerusalem Cleaning.
            Right now, I'm just starting out my business. I'm hoping that the 
            bigger this business gets, the better my services can be. I have a
            trunk full of tools and chemicals needed to do a fantastic job on
            your trash cans and pavements. My goal is to make your pavement look
            clean and your trash bin smell fresh. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The name “New Jerusalem Cleaning” if you don't know, was inspired by
            the New Jerusalem of the bible, where God promises a city that would
            connect both the heavens and the earth. A place with no evil, no 
            unclean thing, no detestable people, but God and <em>his</em> people 
            shall rule and reign there. It is a city made of pure gold, with walls
            made of jasper, and the foundation made of 12 different kinds of
            precious stones. A remarkably beautiful city!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My mission is to make your home something akin to that promised
            city. Of course, I'm not promising jasper trash cans and golden
            driveways, but I don't think any person should have to deal with
            horrific trash cans and dirt packed patios. I want to make your
            house something enjoyable to look at and live in, even down to your
            trash cans! Driven by a genuine desire to transform your outdoor
            areas into inviting sanctuaries, New Jerusalem Cleaning is here to 
            aid you to that end.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thank you for considering New Jerusalem Cleaning for your cleaning
            needs. I look forward to exceeding your expectations and playing a
            role in elevating the cleanliness and charm of your home.
