            Hi, my name is David Navarro, founder of New Jerusalem Cleaning.
            Right now, I'm just starting out my business. In my car, I have a
            trunk full of tools and chemicals needed to do a fantastic job on
            your trash cans and pavements. My goal is to make your pavement look
            clean and your trash bin smell fresh. I'm hoping that the bigger
            this business gets, the better my services can be.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The name “New Jerusalem Cleaning” if you don't know, was inspired by
            the New Jerusalem of the bible, where God promises a city that would
            connect both the heavens and the earth. A place without evil, where
            no unclean thing, no detestable people, but God and his people shall
            rule and reign there. It is a city made of pure gold, the walls are
            made of jasper, and the foundation are 12 different kinds of
            precious stones. A remarkably beautiful city!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My mission is to make your home something akin to that promised
            city. Of course, I'm not promising jasper trash cans and golden
            driveways, but I don't think any person should have to deal with
            horrific trash cans and dirt packed patios. I want to make your
            house something enjoyable to look at and live in, even down to your
            trash cans! Driven by a genuine desire to transform your outdoor
            areas into inviting sanctuaries, New Jerusalem Cleaning is here to
            help aid you to that end.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thank you for considering New Jerusalem Cleaning for your cleaning
            needs. I look forward to exceeding your expectations and playing a
            role in elevating the cleanliness and charm of your home.
